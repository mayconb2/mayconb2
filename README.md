### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maycon, I am 28 yers old and a Software Developer passionate.

I like to code with NodeJs and Golang. But, above all, I belive that programing languages are just tools. Solve interesting problems is my real motivation, independent which language.

A little about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with PHP, HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and Oracle DB on Softplan - FlorianÃ³polis;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and studing NodeJs, Golang, React, Angular and MongoDB;
- ðŸ“« You can fin dme and send me a message on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maycon-de-souza-485114164/);  
- âš¡ I'm also an entrepreneur. I have one Language School that helps people to live on Canada!

I hope you enjoy my Github profile :)
