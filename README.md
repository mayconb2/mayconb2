### Hi there 👋

My name is Maycon, I am 28 years old and :heart: developing software .

I like to code with NodeJs and Golang. But, above all, I belive that programing languages are just tools. Solve interesting problems is my real motivation, independent which language.

A little about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working with JAVA, (Java EE, JBoss, Struts I and some times Spring) on Softplan - Florianópolis;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and studing NodeJs, Golang, React, Angular and MongoDB;
- 📫 You can fin dme and send me a message on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maycon-de-souza-485114164/);  

I hope you enjoy my Github profile :)
